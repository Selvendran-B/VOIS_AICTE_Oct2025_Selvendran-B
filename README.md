Problem Statement:

The Hospitality industry has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of online platforms facilitating short-term lodging and tourism. Leading this revolution is Airbnb, Inc., a pioneering American company that has reshaped travel accommodation through its innovative online marketplace. Established in 2008 in San Francisco, California, Airbnb provides a diverse range of lodging options, offering guests a unique and personalized experience. Unlike traditional hospitality providers, Airbnb operates on a commission-based model, facilitating transactions between hosts and guests without owning the properties listed on its platform.

This research analysis delves into the New York City Airbnb dataset to extract meaningful insights. Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques, the study aims to illuminate the dynamics of the city's lodging market. By discerning factors influencing listing availability, pricing strategies, and overall customer satisfaction, the research contributes to a deeper understanding of Airbnb's operations in one of the world's most dynamic urban environments. These insights hold significance for stakeholders and enthusiasts seeking to navigate the evolving landscape of short-term accommodation.
